## Waypoint 4: Importer Confirmation 

The importer remains legally responsible for importing goods despite being unable to properly attest to the accuracy of the data relating to goods he has not seen and did not pack. This data is already in the ‘pipeline’ from Waypoints, 1, 2 and 3, captured from the right, accountable source. Pipelines confirm parity between Purchase Order (raised by the buyer/importer) and the Shipping Note (raised by the seller/shipper/exporter) and the Container Manifest/Packing List (raised by the seller/shipper/exporter/consignor/consolidator). Sometimes this is also associated with physical quality control on behalf of the buyer/importer. Nevertheless, currently, the importer has to provide this data on an import declaration which can be drawn from the ‘pipeline’.  
 
Under Customs Freight Simplified Procedures (CFSP) this point could equate to a Supplementary Declaration but with minimal top-up data, such as duty liability and customs procedure to complement data from Waypoints 1, 2 and 3.
 
Waypoint 4 may also serve as a self-assessment message by the importer. To achieve this the message must contain any essential Trade Statistical data as well as the 40 data items from the Union Customs Code, Implementing Act, Annex 21-01, Article 55, Data requirements on the surveillance of goods.
