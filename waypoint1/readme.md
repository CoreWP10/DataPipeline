##Consignment Completion Point - Waypoint 1

Purchase order and packing list compared and confirmed as goods loaded into the container, doors closed, electronic seal applied, person identified as responsible for the loading and the accuracy of the data, goods ready to start the international movement. Most of the data relating to the consignment (description, weight, sale value, incoterms) and the entities involved (buyer, seller, consignor, consignee) is known at this point. 

For FCLs this point could be at the factory where loading is completed and would reflect the Master Bill. For LCLs this point could be at the place of consolidation. 

The data for each consignment (buyer, seller) will be known and captured and would reflect the House Bills. The consolidated consignment (consignor, consignee) would reflect the Master Bill supported by the House Bills.
