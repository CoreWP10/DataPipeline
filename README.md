## DataPipeline

Repository of the Waypoint Documents and full data pipeline for the CORE Project, work package 10

The data pipeline is a carrier to provide accurate and timely information to government agencies (i.e. Port Health, Border Force etc) in a structured useable format.

To do so the data *MUST* be provided using a *single window* approach, which means that data cannot be requested more than once, so accomodate this the datapipeline has been split into 4 distinct waypoints, in each folder there is a description of the waypoint which indicates at which milestone the data should be sent.  Therefore the full datapipeline description, MIG and image are for reference only and setting up the full strucutre should you need to.  

To implement the datapipeline you should implement each message waypoint accordingly, this is how the recipients would expect to recieve the data within government.
