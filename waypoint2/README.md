## Waypoint 2: Departure Confirmation

The data at this point confirms that the goods described at Waypoint 1 have been loaded onto a ship and the ship has departed. 
In the days of general cargo the Bill of Lading, as a contract of carriage and document of title would have been signed and finalised by the vessel’s Chief Officer and Agent before the vessel sailed. 
In these days of fast turnaround of very large container ships the Bill of Lading is finalised about 48 hours after sailing. 

As the ‘pipeline’ data package will be comprehensive enough to have fed any pre-departure risk assessment, 24 hours prior to loading (data from Waypoint 1) and any carriage and financial data such as a Bill of Lading, Letter of Credit or Marine Cargo Insurance, the ‘pipeline’ Waypoint 2 will be 48 hours after sailing.
