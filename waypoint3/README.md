## Waypoint 3: Pre-arrival 

The Importer, the Agents, the Terminal Operator, the cargo handlers, the logistic providers and the border agencies need to know when the cargo is likely to arrive at the port of discharge. The data relating to the cargo and the entities involved along with key logistics data will have already been provided from Waypoints 1 and 2. Waypoint 3 is at about 24 hours prior to arrival to allow logistics planning and final risk assessment by border agencies. Under Customs Freight Simplified Procedures (CFSP) this point could equate to a Simplified Frontier Declaration but with a more comprehensive data set drawn from Waypoints 1 and 2 and additional arrival data.
 
The pipelines should have collected data about where the goods have been since the port of loading. Border agencies identify certain trans-shipment ports as high risk because criminal elements can attack legitimate containers and either steal goods or place illegal goods into the containers for later clandestine collection (rip-on, rip-off). Containers can sometimes be unsecure if unloaded from a ship and re-loaded onto the same or a different ship.
 
Under certain circumstances, in the future, Customs and other agencies may be able to release the goods from border control prior to arrival to provide a high degree of planning confidence for the importer and logistics providers.
 
Currently, the time and date of lodging the import declaration and the actual arrival message provided to the border agencies is essential for duty and tax purposes.
